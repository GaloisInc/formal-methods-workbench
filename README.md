DARPA CASE program


## Commons
The `commons` directory contains artifacts that may be useful for any CASE performer, such as Java libraries or Eclipse plugins.

If you would like to modify or add to a commons project, please make your changes on a separate branch, and make a pull request to incorporate your changes.  See the project's `README.md` to determine who owns it and is responsible for reviewing and merging your changes.  If the README does not state who owns the project, message the authors to find out.
